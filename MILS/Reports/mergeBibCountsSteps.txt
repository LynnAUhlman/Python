===Steps===

1) Retrieve Files
Navigate to SimplyReports > My Reports > File Maintenance > Scheduled Reports Files using the minhq-reports login.
Ensure the file names follow this format:
[Count Bibs][ ][librarycode][_m_d_yyy_h_m_ss].xls
Example: Count Bibs jam_5_1_2024_4_0_14.xls.

2) Move Files
Place the retrieved files into the milsbibs2024_txt folder.

3) Open Anaconda
Change the working directory to the location of the mergeBibCounts.py script:
cd /d "G:\Shared drives\MILS -- MIN\Statistics\2024\BibCounts"

4) Convert File Extensions
Run the script to change file extensions from .xls to .txt (the actual file format):
python change_file_extension.py

5) Convert to .xlsx Format
Run the script to convert .txt files to .xlsx format:
python convert_txt_to_xlsx.py

6) Merge Files
Run the script to merge the .xlsx files into one combined worksheet:
python mergeBibCounts.py

The script will print progress messages, such as:
Merging files...
Files Merged...

7)Prepare the Final Workbook
Copy the template file Bib Counts 2024.xlsx.
Rename the file, appending the numeric date (MMDD) to the year (e.g., Bib Counts 20240501.xlsx).

8)Copy Data
Open BibCountCombined_2024.xlsx and copy the data to the Bib Counts sheet in the newly created workbook.

9) Quality Check
Verify that all libraries have data present.
Check for accuracy and ensure there are no drastic anomalies in the numbers.
