--Grab the files from SimplyReports>My Reports>File Maintenance>Scheduled reports files using minhq-reports login.
--The file names should all look like the following: [Count Bibs][ ][librarycode][_m_d_yyy_h_m_ss][.xls] jam_5_1_2024_4_0_14_.xls (example:Count Bibs jam_5_1_2024_4_0_14_.xls)

--Put the files into the FLIP FOLDER
--Change the extension to .txt using the .bat
--Open Anaconda
--Switch the file path to the upper folder where the change_file_extension and convert_txt_to_xlsx.py scripts are located:
    cd /d "G:\Shared drives\MILS -- MIN\Statistics\2024\"
--call the script:  \* switches the files to .xls to .txt format*/
    python change_file_extension.py
--call the script:  \* switches the files to .xlsx format*/ 
    python convert_txt_to_xlsx.py
--Once the Files have been converted, clean up sheets and save.
--Double check the #s to make sure all current libraries have data present and that the numbers aren't drastically off.
--Once the quality check is complete, upload into the Polaris Reports Manager at https://mils.polarislibrary.com/reports/browse/. File path: Polaris>Custom>MILS Top Hits> and their corresponding folder
