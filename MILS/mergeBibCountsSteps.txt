STEPS
1.  Grab the files from SimplyReports>My Reports>File Maintenance>Scheduled reports files using minhq-reports login.
2.  The file names should all look like the following: [Count Bibs][ ][librarycode][_m_d_yyy_h_m_ss][.xls] jam_5_1_2024_4_0_14_.xls (example:Count Bibs jam_5_1_2024_4_0_14_.xls)
3.  Put the files into the milsbibs2024_todo folderas .xlsx files.
4.  Open Anaconda
5.  Switch the file path to the upper folder where the mergeBibCounts.py script is located:
    cd /d "G:\Shared drives\MILS -- MIN\Statistics\2024\BibCounts"
6.  call the script:
    python mergeBibCounts.py
7.  If there are no errors, the script will print messages noting what it is doing:
    Merging files...
    Files Merged...
8.  Once the Files have been merged, copy the template (Bib Counts 2024TEMPLATE01.xlsx) replacing TEMPLATE with the numeric mm (month).
9.  Copy the data from the BibCountCombined_2024.xlsx file and paste into the Bib Counts sheet in the workbook created in step 8.
10. Double check the #s to make sure all current libraries have data present and that the numbers aren't drastically off.
11. Once the quality check is complete, upload into the Polaris Reports Manager at https://mils.polarislibrary.com/reports/browse/. File path: Polaris>Custom>MILS Top Hits>Bib Counts
