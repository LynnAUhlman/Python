--Grab the files from SimplyReports>My Reports>File Maintenance>Scheduled reports files using minhq-reports login.
--The file names should all look like the following: [Count Bibs][ ][librarycode][_m_d_yyy_h_m_ss][.xls] jam_5_1_2024_4_0_14_.xls (example:Count Bibs jam_5_1_2024_4_0_14_.xls)
--Put the files into the milsbibs2024_txt folder.
--Open Anaconda
--Switch the file path to the upper folder where the mergeBibCounts.py script is located:
    cd /d "G:\Shared drives\MILS -- MIN\Statistics\2024\BibCounts"
--call the script: \* switches the extension from .xls to .txt which it is actually formatted as. this allows the following scripts to work correctly */
    python change_file_extension.py
--once the files are converted to .txt
--call the script:  \* switches the files to .xlsx format*/ 
    python convert_txt_to_xlsx.py
--call the script:  \* merges the files into one .xlsx worksheet */ 
    python mergeBibCounts.py
    ---If there are no errors, the script will print messages noting what it is doing:
        Merging files...
        Files Merged...
--Once the Files have been merged, copy the template (BibCount2024.xlsx) adding the numeric mmdd (month day) after the year (no splaces).
--Copy the data from the BibCountCombined_2024.xlsx file and paste into the Bib Counts sheet in the workbook created in step 8.
--Double check the #s to make sure all current libraries have data present and that the numbers aren't drastically off.
--Once the quality check is complete, upload into the Polaris Reports Manager at https://mils.polarislibrary.com/reports/browse/. File path: Polaris>Custom>MILS Top Hits>Bib Counts
